Newly created version

This page displays the contents of the file version.txt in the subdirectory named after your new version.

You are supposed to put information about your new version into that file.

Use either of these two methods:

A: While RunGTAP is NOT running, use a text editor to enter details of your new version in the file version.txt.

B: Use Tools..Options to switch on "Developer Mode". Then edit this page directly within RunGTAP. Then use Developer..Save Version.txt.

Do you prefer a monospace font ? When a version is loaded, the version information will be shown in Courier font if the first character of line 1 in version.txt is a blank.
