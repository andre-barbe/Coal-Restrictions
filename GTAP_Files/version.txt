GTAP-E: Energy-environmental extension of GTAP

version 6-pre2b:
*   homogeneously closable
*   tax revenue equations corrected
*   tax variables retained


1.	THEORETICAL STRUCTURE

The initial implementation is documented in GTAP Technical Paper No. 16, "GTAP-E: An Energy-Environmental Version of the GTAP Model" by Jean-Marc Burniaux and Truong P. Truong, revised version, January 2002.

GTAP-E extends the standard GTAP theoretical structure with inter-fuel and energy-capital substitution in production, carbon dioxide emission accounting, carbon taxation, and emission trading.

The current version, release 6-pre2, is taken from ongoing work by Alla Golub and Robert McDougall.  It provides bug fixes, simplifications, a more complete representation of technological change, and resynchronization with standard model release 6.2.


2.	DATA BASE

The data base derives from standard data base release 8.0.  Extensions to the parameters file cover substitution in production and consumption, and emission trading.  Extensions to the data file cover carbon dioxide emissions, emission quotas, and carbon taxation.

3.	EXPERIMENTS

gtap	numeraire shock
notr	Annex I emission reduction with no use of the flexibility mechanisms
tr	Annex I emission reduction with emission trading among Annex I countries only
wtr	Annex I emission reduction with worldwide emission trading

For the Annex 1 trading scenario, the regions counted as Annex 1 are:
	USA
	JPN
	EEFSU
	EU27
	RoA1

Non-Annex 1 regions are:
	CHN
	IND
	EEX
	RoW

Because of the use of data base v.7.1 and different emission targets, and also (to smaller degree) emission accounting and carbon taxation bug fixes, results differ from those reported in Technical Paper No. 16.  
Because of changes in the theoretical structure, the advice on closure in Annexes 2 and 3 is no longer applicable.
