  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      266 variables comprising 37 thousand components
  and 261 equation blocks comprising 29 thousand separate equations.
  
      55 variables (comprising 16 thousand components) will be backsolved for.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were substituted out.
      2 variables (comprising 1053 components) were omitted.
  
  So the condensed model contains:
      209 variables comprising 20 thousand components
  and 206 equation blocks comprising 12 thousand separate equations.
