  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      266 variables comprising 37 thousand components
  and 261 equation blocks comprising 29 thousand separate equations.
  
      55 variables (comprising 16 thousand components) will be backsolved for.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were substituted out.
      2 variables (comprising 1053 components) were omitted.
  
  So the condensed model contains:
      209 variables comprising 20 thousand components
  and 206 equation blocks comprising 12 thousand separate equations.

  [Total CPU is 1766.7656 seconds.]
  
  (Minimum values for successful completion seem to be:
    MMNZ=247778, MMNZ1=247778, MMNZ2=178452.)
  
  %% ADVICE. During this run MMNZ,MMNZ1 were
       reallocated 1 times. This may have
     slowed down this run considerably.
   We strongly suggest that you include an appropriate
     statement of the form "start with mmnz = <value> ;"
       in your Command file.
   [See Section 32.3 of the GEMPACK Manual, "MMNZ: Allocating memory for the LU
    decomposition".][TopicID:gpd3.13.3]
   [Be guided by the minimum values shown just above.]
  
  Total memory currently used for all arrays is approximately 4.97 megabytes.
  [This does NOT include memory related to MMNZ, MMNZ1 and MMNZ2. The
   associated arrays are not allocated.]
  [Add about 5-10 megabytes for the memory used by the code.]
  [The likely maximum memory used in this run has
    been reported earlier - search for "most memory".]
  
  
  %% Information. If you had a source-code version of GEMPACK and
    were using a TABLO-generated program instead of GEMSIM,
   the total CPU time would have been considerably less
   (probably 50 to 80 per cent less).
  
  Maximum residual ratio across whole simulation is 1.17695052E-07
